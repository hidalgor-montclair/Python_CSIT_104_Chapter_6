# This function is called add.
# It takes two inputs: x and y, and it returns the result of adding them together.
def add(x, y):
    return x + y  # It adds x and y and returns the result

# Now, we are going to test the add() function with numbers.
# This line calls add(5, 7), which adds 5 and 7, and prints the result.
print(f'add(5, 7) is {add(5, 7)}')  # This will print: add(5, 7) is 12

# Now, we are testing the add() function with words (strings).
# This line calls add('Tora', 'Bora'), which adds the two words together (concatenates them).
print(f"add('Tora', 'Bora') is {add('Tora', 'Bora')}")  # This will print: add('Tora', 'Bora') is ToraBora
